# Hello ðŸ‘‹
This is a Friends List App. I created just because I wanted to learn web development using Rails.

I followed [this](https://youtu.be/fmyvWz5TUWg) Learn Ruby on Rails course on freeCodeCamp.org's YouTube channel, extensively instructed by [Codemy.com](http://Codemy.com) John Elder (@flatplanet).


This project involves a bunch of technologies:
* Ruby on Rails
* SQLite
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
